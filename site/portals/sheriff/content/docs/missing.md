summary: What you see when you visit a link to a page that doesn't exist yet. 
^^^^

The link you clicked belongs to a page that hasn't been created yet. It would be a different color from a normal link, and usually this means that someone put a placeholder wikilink somewhere. Like this:

- `[[focus-panel]]`
- `[[focus-panel|FocusPanel]]`
- `[[focus-panels]]`
- `[[focus-panels|Focus Panels]]`

Notice above that the first version doesn't exist (because the page we want is actually the second one; this is to show you what these links appear like in real time.)

- [[focus-panel]]
- [[focus-panel|FocusPanel]]
- [[focus-panels]]
- [[focus-panels|Focus Panels]]

## Notes
Note that this differs from a regular [[404]] page (you can see ours there). If you try to visit a page directly that doesn't exist, you will end up with a 404 missing page error. *These specific missing page links* only appear if you use a wikilink that points to a page that doesn't exist.
