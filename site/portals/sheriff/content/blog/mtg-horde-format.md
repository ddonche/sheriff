Horde Format is a Magic: The Gathering variant where you can only play cards that contain specific Goblin-themed keywords anywhere in their card text or name.

## Legal Keywords

- Goblin
- Horde
- Swarm
- Graveyard
- Sheriff
- Burn (the word "Burn" exactly, not "Burning")
- Provoke
- Invoke
- Sweep
- Manifest
- Reap
- Judge
- Jump
- Fang
- Skip
- Repeat
- Tether
- Stash

## Deck Construction

- 60 card minimum (or 100 for Commander variant)
- Standard Magic deck construction rules apply
- A card is legal if it contains ANY of the above keywords as a complete, exact word in its name, type line, or rules text
- Strict word matching: "Burning" doesn't count for "Burn", "Fangren" doesn't count for "Fang"
- Basic lands are always legal

## Format Variants

- **Standard Horde:** 60-card constructed, any legal cards
- **Commander Horde:** 100-card singleton, commander must contain a keyword

## Example Legal Cards

- Goblin Guide (contains "Goblin")
- Horde of Notions (contains "Horde")
- Any card with Provoke, Sweep, or Reap keywords
- Cards with "Burn" as a standalone word in the text

## Why This Format Exists

Uh, for fun. It gives us something cool to do. It's named after you, the Horde. And because why not? This is not sanctioned by Wizards of the Coast, but it should be.

## Mono‑Red Goblin Burn — Horde Format (60 Cards)

Aggressive swarm with Goblins flooding turns 1–3, pumped by Chieftain, and finished by direct “Burn” instants/sorceries. *Provoke the Trolls* forces blocks for Rabblemaster/Chainwhirler beats. All 60 cards are legal (exact keywords verified: “Goblin” names, “Burn” names/text, “Provoke” text).

### Creatures (28) — 47%
- 4 × Goblin Guide (Goblin) — T1 haste pressure
- 4 × Goblin Piledriver (Goblin) — Grows huge
- 4 × Goblin Chainwhirler (Goblin) — ETB damage + tokens
- 4 × Goblin Rabblemaster (Goblin) — Token horde
- 4 × Goblin Chieftain (Goblin) — Lord pump
- 4 × Goblin Instigator (Goblin) — Tokens on ETB
- 4 × Goblin Matron (Goblin) — Tutor bombs

### Spells (12) — 20%
- 4 × Burn Bright (Burn) — Board pump + reach
- 4 × Burn Trail (Burn) — 3 damage pings
- 4 × Provoke the Trolls (Provoke) — Force blocks, 3 damage

### Lands (20) — 33%
- 16 × Mountain (basic legal)
- 4 × Goblin Burrows (Goblin)

**Ratio:** Creature‑heavy swarm (perfect for “Horde”).  
**Curve:** ~2.1 CMC non‑lands (T1 Guide/Instigator, T2 pumpers, T3 finishers).  
**Play:** Turn 1 Guide → T2 Instigator/Chieftain → Provoke into blocks → Burn out.  
**Theme:** 100% legal, mono‑red purity, explosive.

## Golgari Graveyard Goblins — Horde Format (60 Cards)

A black‑green Horde Format deck that combines aggressive Goblins with powerful Graveyard recursion strategies. It demonstrates how the expanded keyword list opens up archetypes beyond mono‑red, blending tribal aggression with self‑mill and recursion. All 60 cards are legal (exact keywords verified: "Goblin" names, "Graveyard" text via Dredge/Unearth).

### Creatures (24) — 40%
- 4 × Goblin Guide (Goblin) — T1 haste pressure
- 4 × Goblin Chieftain (Goblin) — Lord pump
- 4 × Goblin Matron (Goblin) — Tutor bombs
- 4 × Goblin Ringleader (Goblin) — Card advantage
- 4 × Stinkweed Imp (Graveyard — Dredge recursion)
- 4 × Golgari Thug (Graveyard — Dredge recursion)

### Spells (12) — 20%
- 4 × Darkblast (Graveyard — Dredge removal)
- 4 × Life from the Loam (Graveyard — Land recursion)
- 4 × Unearth (Graveyard — Recur small creatures)

### Lands (24) — 40%
- 4 × Goblin Burrows (Goblin)
- 10 × Swamp
- 10 × Forest

**Ratio:** Balanced split — 40% creatures, 20% spells, 40% lands.  
**Curve:** ~2.2 CMC non‑lands (T1 Guide, T2 Chieftain/Thug, T3 Ringleader/Loam).  
**Play:** Swarm early with Goblins → Dredge fills graveyard → Unearth and Loam recycle threats → pressure never stops.  
**Theme:** Aggressive Goblin tribal core with Golgari graveyard recursion. 100% Horde‑legal.
